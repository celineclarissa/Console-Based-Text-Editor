# Console Based Text Editor 📝
This repository presents a console-based text editor implemented in Python. It is designed to work on a single line of text, supporting various cursor manipulations, text insertions, deletions, and history tracking features such as undo and repeat. 

## Background ❓
I am a freshman data science student building foundational programming skills through hands-on projects. This editor was developed as an assignment of a course to reinforce key concepts in string handling, user input parsing, and command execution flow—all within a non-object-oriented, procedural programming approach.

## Problem Statement 🔍
Build and design a simple but powerful single-line editor requires handling many aspects of user interaction, including cursor movement, character-wise editing, command parsing, and maintaining edit history. The goal of this assignment is to simulate a real text editing environment in the command line, complete with helpful features like undo and command repetition, using only fundamental Python programming techniques.

## Features 🛠️
* Display help information for available commands (?)
* Toggle the cursor (.)
* Move cursor: left (h), right (l), start (^), end ($)
* Jump between words: next (w), previous (b)
* Insert (i) and append (a) text
* Delete single character (x) or word (dw)
* Undo last command (u)
* Repeat last command (r)
* Display the current text and cursor position (s)
* Quit program (q)

## Skills 💻
* Refactoring: logic reuse or simplification based on the existing logic.
* Variable scope: global, local and function parameters.
* Coding styles: naming convention, meaningful names, comments, doc_string, etc.
* Problem decomposition, clean dode, top-down design.
* Functions (with parameters and return) for program structure and logic decomposition.
* Standard objects: strings, numbers & lists.

## Technologies 👩🏻‍💻
* Python
* Regular Expressions (re module)
